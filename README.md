# BeeBop
### Overview

BeeBop is a combination iOS app and physical device designed to help improve living conditions for children with hemiplegia, a neurological disorder. It was designed and built in the spring of 2016 by Ari Scourtas, Ferdinand Dowouo, Jake Hellman, Katia Kravchenko, Rob Lasell, Trish O'Connor for Ming Chow and Ron Lasser's Mobile Medical Devices class at Tufts University.

We have been having some issues with storyboards - if elements are not displaying on the storyboard, try changing the width and height at the bottom of the page to Compact and Regular, respectively.
